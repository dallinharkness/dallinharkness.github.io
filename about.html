            Hello! My name is Dallin Harkness, and I am pursuing the field of Cyber Security. Growing up I have always had an interest in computers and technology, and it's a good feeling to be starting a career on that path. I am thankful for experiences that have led me here along the way. Back in middle school I decided to take a computer class, and in highschool I enrolled in a web development class. It is because of those small experiences I was able to make the decision to look more into coding into adulthood. Enrolling in DevMountain allowed me to learn about various career paths, and ultimately Cyber Security! I've found a passion and love for Cyber Security; it is truly fascinating. I do tryhackme.com on my free time to learn, and I have plans to get compTIA certifications. I hope one day to become an "expert" in the field!
